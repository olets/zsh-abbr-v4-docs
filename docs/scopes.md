# Scopes

A given abbreviation can be limited to the current zsh session (i.e. the current terminal) —these are called *session* abbreviations— or to all terminals —these are called *user* abbreviations. Select commands take **scope** as an argument.

Newly added user abbreviations are available to all open sessions immediately.

Default is user.
